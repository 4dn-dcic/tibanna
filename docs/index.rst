What do I need to run pipelines using Tibanna?
----------------------------------------------

- Your pipeline
- Your data

Pipeline
++++++++

- The commands to run your pipeline must be written in either Common Workflow Language (CWL_) (recommended), Workflow Description Language (WDL_) (only basic support), Snakemake_ or a list of shell commands.
- The pipelines may be local CWL/WDL/Snakemake files or they should be downloadable from public urls. 
- With the exception of Snakemake, your pipeline and dependencies must be pre-installed as a Docker image (https://www.docker.com/). For Snakemake, conda can be used instead.
