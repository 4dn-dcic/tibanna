Overview

Tibanna is a software tool that helps you run genomic pipelines on the cloud.

It is also used by 4DN-DCIC (4D Nucleome Data Coordination and Integration Center) to process data.


What do I need to run pipelines using Tibanna?
----------------------------------------------

- Your pipeline
- Your data
- An Amazon Web Services (AWS) cloud account
- Tibanna


Pipeline
++++++++

- Your pipeline and dependencies must be pre-installed in a docker image
- The commands to run your pipeline must be written in Common Workflow Language


Data
++++

- Your data must be pre-uploaded to a permanent storage on the cloud (called S3 bucket).


AWS cloud account
+++++++++++++++++

- check https://aws.amazon.com/ 


Tibanna
+++++++

- Tibanna is open-source and can be found at https://github.com/4dn-dcic/tibanna
- Once installed, tibanna can be run either as a set of commend-line tools or a set of python modules


**Command-line tools**

::

    $ invoke run_workflow --input-json=run1.json


**Python**

::

    >>> from core.utils import run_workflow
    >>> run_workflow(input_json=run1)

Tibanna is auto-triggered upon data submission to execute a relevant workflow on the data. It utilizes two-layer scheduling; an upstream regulator based on a state machine called AWS Step Function and a downstream workflow engine that runs Docker/CWL-based pipelines. Tibannaâ€™s AWS Step Function launches several AWS Serverless Lambda functions that control workflow-related metadata generation/tracking and deployment of a workflow on a pre-custom-configured autonomous virtual machine (EC2 instance) (AWSEM; Autonomous Workflow Step Executor Machine).

In addition, Tibanna offers multi-layer real-time monitoring to ensure the workflows are executed flawlessly. AWSEM sends real time logs from Docker/CWL to a designated S3 Bucket; individual AWS Lambda functions are checked through AWS CloudWatch; AWS Step function communicates with users at the top level. The system allows users to ssh into the EC2 instance where a workflow is currently being executed, to allow detailed investigation. Tibanna uses AWS IAM roles to ensure secure access. We have also implemented an accompanying resource optimizer for Tibanna (https://github.com/4dn-dcic/pipelines-cwl/tree/master/Benchmark), which calculates total CPU, memory and space required for a specific workflow run to determine EC2 instance type and EBS (Elastic Block Store) volume size. The calculation is based on input size, workflow parameters and the benchmarking results characteristic of individual workflows. The resource optimizer is essential for automated parameterization of data-dependent workflow runs, while maximizing the benefit of the elasticity of the cloud platform. Tibanna currently uses this optimizer to auto-determine instance types and EBS sizes for 4DN workflow runs.

Tibanna has been evolving: originally developed for Desktop workflow submitter that launches an autonomous VM, then upgraded to a Chalice/Lambda/API-Gateway-based system that works with the Seven Bridges Genomics (SBG) platform, and it currently consists of the original modules integrated with AWS Step functions for upstream scheduling and monitoring, without SBG.
