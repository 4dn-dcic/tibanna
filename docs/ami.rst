====================
Amazon Machine Image
====================

Tibanna now uses a single Amazon Machine Image (AMI) ``ami-0f06a8358d41c4b9c``, which is made public for ``us-east-1``. One can find them among Community AMIs. (Tibanna automatically finds and uses them, so no need to worry about it.)

For regions that are not ``us-east-1``, a copy of the same AMI is publicly available (different AMI ID) and is auto-detected by Tibanna.
