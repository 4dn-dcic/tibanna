====================
Amazon Machine Image
====================

Tibanna now uses a the Amazon Machine Images (AMI) ``ami-06e2266f85063aabc`` (``x86``) and ``ami-0e12894d2dc91ab8c`` (``Arm``), which are made public for ``us-east-1``. One can find them among Community AMIs. (Tibanna automatically finds and uses them, so no need to worry about it.)

For regions that are not ``us-east-1``, copies of these AMIs is publicly available (different AMI IDs) and are auto-detected by Tibanna.
