hello
-----

We will run a command that prints *hello world* through Tibanna. To do this, we just need to prepare for a job description json and run tibanna.


Job description
+++++++++++++++

To run the pipeline on a specific input file using Tibanna, we need to create an *job description* file for each execution (or a dictionary object if you're using Tibanna as a python module).

The job description for running shell commands requires ``command`` and ``container_image`` fields. The former is a list of commands and the latter is the Docker image name. Here, we use ``ubuntu:20.04`` image and use an ``echo`` command. Notice that double-quotes are escaped inside the command string. We're passing an environment variable ``$NAME`` through the field ``input_env``. Also notice that the environment variable's ``$`` sign is prefixed with an escaped backslash in the ``command`` string.

In the following example, the output file ``hello.txt`` in the same directory is copied to the output bucket ``my-tibanna-test-bucket`` as ``some_sub_dirname/my_first_hello.txt``.

This json can be found at https://github.com/4dn-dcic/tibanna/blob/master/examples/hello/hello_shell_input.json

Tibanna run
+++++++++++

To run Tibanna,

1. Sign up for AWS
2. Install and configure ``awscli``

  see Before_using_Tibanna_

3. Install Tibanna on your local machine

  see Installation_

4. Deploy Tibanna (link it to the AWS account)

  see Installation_

.. _Installation: https://tibanna.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html


5. Run workflow as below.

    ::

        cd tibanna
        tibanna run_workflow --input-json=examples/hello/hello_shell_input.json    


6. Check status

    ::

        tibanna stat


7. Check output file


    Let's try downloading the output file to check the content.

    ::

        aws s3 cp s3://my-tibanna-test-bucket/some_sub_dirname/my_first_hello.txt .


    The output file ``my_first_hello.txt`` would look as below.

    ::

        Hello world, Soo!
