merge
-----

This pipeline is an example of a nested input file array (e.g. ``[[f1, f2], [f3, f4]]``).
It consists of two steps, ``paste`` and ``cat``, the former pastes input files horrizontally and the latter concatenates input files vertically. Since we're using generic commands, we do not need to create a pipeline software component or a Docker image. We will use the existing ``ubuntu:20.04`` Docker image. So, we will just do the following three steps.

1. create the pipeline description using either *CWL* or *WDL*.
2. prepare for a job definition that specifies pipeline, input files, parameters, resources, output target, etc.
3. run Tibanna.
 

Data
++++

For input data, let's use files named ``smallfile1``, ``smallfile2``, ``smallfile3`` and ``smallfile4`` in a public bucket named ``my-tibanna-test-input-bucket``. Each of these files contains a letter ('``a``', '``b``', '``c``', and '``d``', respectively). We feed an array of array of these files in the following format:

  ::

      [[smallfile1, smallfile2], [smallfile3, smallfile4]]


(You could also upload your own file to your own bucket and set up Tibanna to access that bucket.)

Thie pipeline takes an input 'smallfiles' which is an array of array of files. The input is scattered to the first step ``paste``, which means that each element of 'smallfiles' (i.e. each array of files) goes as the input of ``paste``, and the outputs will be gathered into an array before it is passed to the next step. From the input data above, there will be two runs of ``paste`` and one will take in ``[smallfile1, smallfile2]`` and the other ``[smallfile3, smallfile4]``, and the outputs will be combined into an array *[<paste_output1>, <paste_output2>]*. The second step, ``cat`` takes in this array and concatenates them.

So, the output of the two ``paste`` runs would look like:

  ::

      a  b


  ::

      c  d


And the output of the ``cat`` (or the output of the workflow) would look like:

  ::

      a  b
      c  d


CWL
###

    Since this is a multi-step pipeline, we use three CWL files, ``merge.cwl`` (master workflow CWL) and two other CWL files ``paste.cwl`` and ``cat.cwl`` that are called by ``merge.cwl``.
    
    These CWL files can be found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4dn-dcic/tibanna/master/examples/merge/merge.cwl, https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4dn-dcic/tibanna/master/examples/merge/paste.cwl and https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4dn-dcic/tibanna/master/examples/merge/cat.cwl.
    To use your own CWL file, you'll need to make sure it is accessible via HTTP so Tibanna can download it with ``wget``: If you're using github, you could use raw.githubusercontent.com like the link above. Alternatively, you can have tham as a local file and provide ``cwl_directory_local`` instead of ``cwl_directory_url``.
   
    The following is ``merge.cwl``. It is of class 'workflow' and defines inputs, outputs and steps. For the other two CWL files (``paste.cwl`` and ``cat.cwl``), see the links above.

        requirements:

    The pipeline is ready!
    
    
WDL
###
    
    WDL describes this pipeline in one file and it can be found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4dn-dcic/tibanna/master/examples/merge/merge.wdl. 
    To use your own WDL file, you'll need to make sure it is accessible via HTTP so Tibanna can download it with ``wget``: If you're using github, you could use raw.githubusercontent.com like the link above.
    Content-wise, this WDL does exactly the same as the above CWL.
    
    ::
    
        workflow merge {
            Array[Array[File]] smallfiles = []
            scatter(smallfiles_ in smallfiles) {
                call paste {input: files = smallfiles_}
            }
            call cat {input: files = paste.pasted}
            output {
                File merged = cat.concatenated
            }
        }
        
        task paste {
            Array[File] files = []
            command {
                paste ${sep=" " files} > pasted
            }
            output {
                File pasted = "pasted"
            }
            runtime {
                docker: "ubuntu:20.04"
            }
        }
        
        task cat {
            Array[File] files = []
            command {
                cat ${sep=" " files} > concatenated
            }
            output {
                File concatenated = "concatenated"
            }
            runtime {
                docker: "ubuntu:20.04"
            }
        } 
            

The pipeline is ready!



Job description
+++++++++++++++

To run the pipeline on a specific input file using Tibanna, we need to create an *job description* file for each execution (or a dictionary object if you're using Tibanna as a python module).


Job description for CWL
#######################
    
    The example job description for CWL is shown below and it can also be found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4dn-dcic/tibanna/master/examples/merge/merge_cwl_input.json.
    
    ::
    
        {
          "args": {
            "app_name": "merge",
            "app_version": "",
            "cwl_directory_url": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4dn-dcic/tibanna/master/examples/merge",
            "cwl_main_filename": "merge.cwl",
            "cwl_child_filenames": ["paste.cwl", "cat.cwl"],
            "cwl_version": "v1",
            "input_files": {
              "smallfiles": {
                "bucket_name": "my-tibanna-test-input-bucket",
                "object_key": [["smallfile1", "smallfile2"], ["smallfile3", "smallfile4"]]
              }
            },
            "secondary_files": {},
            "input_parameters": {},
            "output_S3_bucket": "my-tibanna-test-bucket",
            "output_target": {
              "merged": "some_sub_dirname/my_first_merged_file"
            },
            "secondary_output_target": {}
          },
          "config": {
            "ebs_size": 10,
            "EBS_optimized": true,
            "instance_type": "t3.micro",
            "password": "whateverpasswordworks",
            "log_bucket": "my-tibanna-test-bucket"
          }
        } 
    
    The json file specifies the input nested file array ("smallfiles") (``[["smallfile1", "smallfile2"], ["smallfile3", "smallfile4"]]``), matching the name in CWL. The output file will be renamed to ``some_sub_dirname/my_first_merged_file`` in a bucket named ``my-tibanna-test-bucket``. In the input json, we specify the CWL file with ``cwl_main_filename`` and its url with ``cwl_directory_url``. Note that the file name itself is not included in the url). Note that child CWL files are also specified in this case (``"cwl_child_filenames": ["paste.cwl", "cat.cwl"]``).
    
    We also specified in ``config``, that we need 10GB space total (``ebs_size``) and we're going to run an EC2 instance (VM) of type ``t3.micro`` which comes with 1 CPU and 1GB memory.
    
    
Job description for WDL
#######################
    
    The example job description for WDL is shown below and it can also be found at https://raw.githubusercontent.com/4dn-dcic/tibanna/master/examples/merge/merge_wdl_input.json.
    
    Content-wise, it is exactly the same as the one for CWL above. Notice that the only difference is that 1) you specify fields "wdl_main_filename", "wdl_child_filenames" and "wdl_directory_url" instead of "cwl_main_filename", "cwl_child_filenames", "cwl_directory_url", and "cwl_version" in ``args``, that 2) you have to specify ``"language" : "wdl"`` in ``args`` and that 3) when you refer to an input or an output, CWL allows you to use a global name (e.g. ``smallfiles``, ``merged``), whereas with WDL, you have to specify the workflow name (e.g. ``merge.smallfiles``, ``merge.merged``). We omit the step names in this case because we use global variables that are passed to and from the steps.
