AWSEM
branch awsem
I changed the following in task.py to faciliate deployment of start_run_awsf while developing.
deploy_lambda_package

deploy core 
```
  # return
```


Do not move around the AWSF directory. The directory url is hardcoded in two different locations in AWSEM scripts. - It takes a long time for github to update the raw url which is one of the locations it is hardcoded. So do not move around the directory..
