Open Source & Community Building: Work In Progress
--------------------------------------------------

The CGAP ecosystem is composed of quite a number of repositories. We're developing a common contribution policy and
code of conduct, but that's still work in progress. For the status of that, please see
`CONTRIBUTING.rst in cgap-portal <https://github.com/dbmi-bgm/cgap-portal/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.rst>`_.
