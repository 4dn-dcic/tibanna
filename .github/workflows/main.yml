  workflow_dispatch:

# A workflow run is made up of one or more jobs that can run sequentially or in parallel
# In this case, since this repo (tibanna) has tests which cannot reliablly run concurrently,
# because (at least) they write/read to/from fixed locations in S3, we need to run the tests
# for each of the Python versions serially; so the build_<version> sections below are just
# clones of each other, with the proper version and "needs" clause on the previous build.
# Using the strategy/matrix mechanism as is done in other repos causes the tests to run
# concurrently. TODO: Find a way to do this without having to clone these sections.
