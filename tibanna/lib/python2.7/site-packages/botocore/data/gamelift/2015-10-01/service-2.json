A fleet alias can be used in place of a fleet ID, such as when calling <code>CreateGameSession</code> from a game client or game service or adding destinations to a game session queue. By changing an alias's target fleet, you can switch your players to the new fleet without changing any other component. In production, this feature is particularly useful to redirect your player base seamlessly to the latest game server update. </p> <p>Amazon GameLift supports two types of routing strategies for aliases: simple and terminal. Use a simple alias to point to an active fleet. Use a terminal alias to display a message to incoming traffic instead of routing players to an active fleet. This option is useful when a game server is no longer supported but you want to provide better messaging than a standard 404 error.</p> <p>To create a fleet alias, specify an alias name, routing strategy, and optional description.

(Although the runtime configuration is not a required parameter, the fleet cannot be successfully created without it.) You can also configure the new fleet with the following settings: fleet description, access permissions for inbound traffic, fleet-wide game session protection, and resource creation limit. If you use Amazon CloudWatch for metrics, you can add the new fleet to a metric group, which allows you to view aggregated metrics for a set of fleets.

We recommend using either the Amazon Web Services software development kit (<a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/tools/#sdk\">AWS SDK</a>), available in multiple languages, or the <a href=\"http://aws.amazon.com/cli/\">AWS command-line interface</a> (CLI) tool. Both of these align with the low-level service API. In addition, you can use the <a href=\"https://console.aws.amazon.com/gamelift/home\">AWS Management Console</a> for Amazon GameLift for many administrative actions.</p> <p>You can use some API actions with Amazon GameLift Local, a testing tool that lets you test your game integration locally before deploying on Amazon GameLift. You can call these APIs from the AWS CLI or programmatically; API calls to Amazon GameLift Local servers perform exactly as they do when calling Amazon GameLift web servers.
