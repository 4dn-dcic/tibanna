Pyflakes
========

A simple program which checks Python source files for errors.

Pyflakes analyzes programs and detects various errors.  It works by
parsing the source file, not importing it, so it is safe to use on
modules with side effects.  It's also much faster.

It is `available on PyPI <http://pypi.python.org/pypi/pyflakes>`_
and it supports all active versions of Python from 2.5 to 3.4.
